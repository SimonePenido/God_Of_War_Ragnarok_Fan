Webpage project for promoting the game God Of War Ragnarok, as part of the learning challenge within the #ElasNaTech track in partnership with the IBM Skills Network, JA Brazil, and CCR S.A. Web instructor: Gil Chaves.
Incorporated concepts from the Bootstrap framework, which is a set of tools and libraries providing a pre-built structure. It is used for front-end development, leveraging HTML, CSS, and Javascript resources. It is possible to modify the framework settings, although in this project, I used the compact version .min.css and .min.js.
